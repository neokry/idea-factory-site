1.  Idea Factory members can submit a proposal for “Idea Generation” rounds through a DAO vote. They can be general or around a specific topic.
2.  When passed, a round will then be open for “Imagineers” to come up with and submit their ideas using tools such as Prop House
3.  Idea Factory members vote on which ideas are the best
4.  Builders can then take those ideas and make them a reality!
