title: The Idea Factory Flywheel
order: 1
---

To keep Imagineers imagining new ideas the factory will need funding. The DAO intends to keep the flywheel going in the following ways

Auctions: 100% of the proceeds of the daily auction will go to the treasury.

Idea Fee’s: The DAO would ask that if an idea has been taken from our Imagineers and receives funding that they include a % of their funding request to be returned to the Idea Factory treasury as an ‘Idea Fee’.

Grants: If other DAOs find the idea generation of the factory useful, we would ask that they would grant funds to the treasury.
